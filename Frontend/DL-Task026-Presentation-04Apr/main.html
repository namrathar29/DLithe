                <div class="intro">
                    The Industrial Revolution was a pivotal point in British history that occurred between the
                    mid-eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries and led to far reaching transformations of society. With
                    the
                    advent of revolutionary manufacturing technology productivity boomed. Machines were used to spin and
                    weave cloth, steam engines were used to provide reliable power, and industry was fed by the
                    construction
                    of the first railways, a great network of arteries feeding the factories. Cities grew as people
                    shifted
                    from agriculture to industry and commerce. Hand in hand with the growth of cities came rising levels
                    of
                    pollution and disease. Many people lost their jobs to the new machinery, whilst working conditions
                    in
                    the factories were grim and pay was low. As the middle classes prospered, social unrest ran through
                    the
                    working classes, and the exploitation of workers led to the growth of trade unions and protest
                    movements.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Dating back to around 1760, the First Industrial Revolution was the transition to new
                        manufacturing
                        processes using water and steam.
                        It was hugely beneficial in terms of manufacturing a larger number of various goods and creating
                        a
                        better standard of living for some.
                        The textile industry, in particular, was transformed by industrialization, as was
                        transportation.
                        Fuel sources like steam and coal made machine use more feasible, and the idea of manufacturing
                        with
                        machines quickly spread.
                        Machines allowed faster and easier production, and they made all kinds of new innovations and
                        technologies possible as well.

                        The first Industrial Revolution represented the period between the 1760s and around 1840.
                        This is where the second industrial revolution picked up.
                        Historians sometimes refer to this as “The Technological Revolution” occurring mainly in
                        Britain,
                        Germany and America.
                        During this time, new technological systems were introduced, most notably superior electrical
                        technology
                        which allowed for even greater production and more sophisticated machines.

                    <p>
                        It began with the first computer era.
                        These early computers were often very simple, unwieldy and incredibly large relative to the
                        computing
                        power they were able to provide, but they laid the groundwork for a world today that one is
                        hard-pressed
                        to imagine without computer technology.
                        Around 1970 the Third Industrial Revolution involved the use of electronics and IT (Information
                        Technology) to further automation in production.
                        Manufacturing and automation advanced considerably thanks to Internet access, connectivity and
                        renewable
                        energy.
                        Industry 3.0 introduced more automated systems onto the assembly line to perform human tasks,
                        i.e.
                        using
                        Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC).
                        Although automated systems were in place, they still relied on human input and intervention.

                    <p>
                        The Fourth industrial Revolution is the era of smart machines, storage systems and production
                        facilities
                        that can autonomously exchange information, trigger actions and control each other without human
                        intervention.
                        This exchange of information is made possible with the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) as
                        we
                        know
                        it today. Key elements of Industry 4.0 include:
                        Cyber-physical system — a mechanical device that is run by computer-based algorithms.
                        The Internet of things (IoT) — interconnected networks of machine devices and vehicles embedded
                        with
                        computerized sensing, scanning and monitoring capabilities.
                        Cloud computing — offsite network hosting and data backup.
                        Cognitive computing — technological platforms that employ artificial intelligence.
                        “Industry 4.0 starts to move towards Industry 5.0 when you begin to allow customers to customize
                        what
                        they want."

                    <p>
                        Less than a decade has passed since talk of Industry 4.0 first surfaced in manufacturing
                        circles,
                        yet
                        visionaries are already forecasting the next revolution — Industry 5.0.
                        If the current revolution emphasizes the transformation of factories into IoT-enabled smart
                        facilities
                        that utilize cognitive computing and interconnect via cloud servers, Industry 5.0 is set to
                        focus on
                        the
                        return of human hands and minds into the industrial framework.
                        Industry 5.0 is the revolution in which man and machine reconcile and find ways to work together
                        to
                        improve the means and efficiency of production. Funny enough, the fifth revolution could already
                        be
                        underway among the companies that are just now adopting the principles of Industry 4.0.
                        Even when manufacturers start using advanced technologies, they are not instantly firing vast
                        swaths
                        of
                        their workforce and becoming entirely computerized.
                        The cost of a new product can be determined with the help of costing software for manufacturing
                        industry. It automates the costing processes and accelerates the time to market on new products.
